# 🧹 Clear Orphaned Games

## 🎯 **Problem**
Games created by users who have exited their browsers are still showing in the "Available Games" list.

## 🔧 **Solution**

### **Method 1: Browser Console (Recommended)**

1. **Open the browser console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
2. **Run the cleanup command:**
   ```javascript
   clearAllGames()
   ```
3. **The page will automatically reload** and show a clean state

### **Method 2: Manual Browser Cleanup**

1. **Clear browser storage:**
   - Open browser console
   - Run: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Run: `sessionStorage.clear()`
2. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### **Method 3: Server Restart**

1. **Stop the development server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Refresh the browser page**

### **Method 4: Check Current State**

To see what's currently stored:
```javascript
checkGameState()
```

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

The issue occurs because:
1. **Pusher Hook Caching**: The `usePusher` hook maintains games state in memory
2. **Browser Storage**: User data persists in localStorage/sessionStorage
3. **Server Restart**: In-memory games are cleared when server restarts
4. **State Mismatch**: UI shows cached games that don't exist in backend

## ✅ **Verification**

After cleanup, you should see:
- ✅ **Empty game list** in the UI
- ✅ **No orphaned games** showing
- ✅ **Clean state** when creating new games

## 🚀 **Prevention**

The system now includes:
- **Automatic cleanup** on page load
- **Immediate state clearing** on logout
- **Manual refresh button** in the UI
- **Debug functions** for troubleshooting

## 🎉 **Result**

After running the cleanup, the orphaned games will be removed and the UI will show the correct, empty state.
